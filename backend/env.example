# Environment Variables Template for SendSafe Backend
# 
# WHAT IS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE?
# Think of environment variables as secret settings that your server needs to work,
# but you don't want to share publicly (like passwords or API keys).
# 
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to ".env" (remove the .example part)
# 2. Fill in the actual values (the parts after the = sign)
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file to Git (it should stay private on your computer)
# 4. When deploying to Vercel, you'll add these same variables in their dashboard

# ============================================================================
# OpenAI API Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Your secret API key from OpenAI that lets us use their AI service
# Get this from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Example: sk-proj-abc123def456...
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Which AI model to use for detection
# gpt-4o-mini is faster and cheaper, good for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
# gpt-4o is more accurate but costs more
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# How long to wait for OpenAI's response (in milliseconds)
# 10000 = 10 seconds. If OpenAI takes longer, we'll stop waiting and show an error
OPENAI_TIMEOUT=10000

# ============================================================================
# Security Configuration
# ============================================================================

# A secret password that the Chrome extension must provide to use this API
# This prevents random people on the internet from using your server
# Make this a long, random string. Example: use a password generator
# For MVP: This is stored in BOTH the backend and the extension code
SENDSAFE_SHARED_SECRET=your_random_secret_string_here

# ============================================================================
# Rate Limiting Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Maximum number of checks allowed per IP address per hour
# This prevents abuse and controls costs
# 10 means each IP address can check at most 10 times per hour
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10

# Time window for rate limiting (in minutes)
# 60 = 1 hour
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES=60

# ============================================================================
# Text Processing Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Maximum characters to send to OpenAI
# Longer text costs more money and takes more time
# 5000 characters is about 2-3 pages of text
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH=5000
